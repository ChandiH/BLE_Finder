BLE Location Identifier
A Kotlin-based Android application that uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) sensors to identify and display a user's indoor location based on proximity to beacons.
Features

Scans for BLE beacons using the iBeacon protocol.
Estimates proximity to beacons via RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator).
Displays real-time location (e.g., "You are in Room 101") using Jetpack Compose.
Lightweight and power-efficient BLE scanning.

Prerequisites

Android Studio (Koala or later)
Android device with BLE support (API 21+)
BLE beacons (e.g., Estimote, Kontakt.io) configured with iBeacon protocol

Launch the app to start scanning for nearby beacons.
The UI displays the closest beaconâ€™s location based on RSSI.
Customize beacon mappings in the app for your environment.
